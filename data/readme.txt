Optimizing the conservation of migratory species over their full annual cycle

This archive contains the results from prioritizing land to support at least 30% of the global abundances of a suite of 117 Neotropical migratory bird species. The prioritizations are based on eBird Status and Trends results, which use data from the citizen science project eBird to produce full annual cycle estimates of relative abundace at high spatiotemporal resolution. Schuster et al. (2019) used these abundance maps to identify the optimal set of sites that protect at least 30% of the population of each species under different conservation scenarios. There are a total of eight scenarios, each identified by the following 2-letter codes in the filenames:

- Weekly vs. yearly: prioritize sites for each week individually ("wk"), then combines the selected sites, or simultaneously prioritizes sites for all weeks ("yr").
- Intact habitat vs. shared-use: emphasize the protection of relatively intact habitat ("hf"), based on the Human Footprint Index, or permit the inclusion of landscapes converted to more intensive use by humans ("nh").
- Clustering: protect 30% of the global population of each species ("nc") or spatially cluster the abundance of each species into five groups, then protect 30% of each subpopulation ("cl").

All files are in GeoTiFF format. For weekly scenarios, values range from 1-52 indicating the selection frequency (i.e. number of weeks). For yearly scenarios, selected sites are indicated by a 1.
